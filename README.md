# up-or-down-day-stock-market-indicator
Very simple 30 line brain dead simple indicator to predict if the market will go up or down for the day.

# This script now considers the following
If the VIX is down and SHY is up (implying lower interest rates) and DXY is down, it suggests a bullish sentiment.
Conversely, if the VIX is up and SHY is down and DXY is up, it indicates a bearish sentiment.
The script will print the market sentiment for the day as “Bullish,” “Bearish,” or “Neutral” if the conditions do not match either bullish or bearish criteria.
