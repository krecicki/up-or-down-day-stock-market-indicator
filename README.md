# up-or-down-day-stock-market-indicator
Very simple 30 line brain dead simple indicator to predict if the market will go up or down for the day: if it is bullish, bearish or neutral. 

# This script now considers the following
If the VIX is down and SHY is up (implying lower interest rates) and DXY is down, it suggests a bullish sentiment.
Conversely, if the VIX is up and SHY is down and DXY is up, it indicates a bearish sentiment.
The script will print the market sentiment for the day as “Bullish,” “Bearish,” or “Neutral” if the conditions do not match either bullish or bearish criteria.

VIX (CBOE Volatility Index):

The VIX is a measure of expected volatility in the S&P 500 index.
A lower VIX typically indicates lower expected volatility and is considered a bullish signal for the stock market.


SHY (iShares 1-3 Year Treasury Bond ETF):

SHY tracks the performance of short-term U.S. Treasury bonds.
When SHY rises, it implies that investors are demanding higher prices for short-term bonds, which generally happens when interest rates are expected to decrease.
Lower interest rates are typically seen as bullish for the stock market.


DXY (U.S. Dollar Index):

The DXY measures the value of the U.S. dollar against a basket of major currencies.
A declining DXY indicates a weakening U.S. dollar, which can be bullish for U.S. multinational companies and the stock market in general, as it makes their products and services more competitive in international markets.



Putting it all together:

If the VIX is down (implying lower expected volatility), SHY is up (suggesting lower interest rates), and DXY is down (indicating a weaker U.S. dollar), it is considered a bullish sentiment for the stock market.
Conversely, if the VIX is up (higher expected volatility), SHY is down (suggesting higher interest rates), and DXY is up (stronger U.S. dollar), it is considered a bearish sentiment for the stock market.
